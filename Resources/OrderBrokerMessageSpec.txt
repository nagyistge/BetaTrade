The OrderBroker component listens for trade requests on an ActiveMQ dynamic queue called "OrderBroker". Via JNDI this would be dynamicQueues/OrderBroker.

It sends responses to "OrderBroker_Reply" -- but see below regarding correlation IDs and timing.

Message format is almost the same in each direction. To place a trade order, send a text message bearing an XML representation of the requested trade, as in:

<trade>
  <buy>true</buy> <!-- so, false for a sale -->
  <id>0</id>
  <price>88.0</price>
  <size>2000</size>
  <stock>HON</stock>
  <whenAsDate>2014-07-31T22:33:22.801-04:00</whenAsDate>
</trade>

All fields are required.

The broker also looks for a JMS correlation ID, and bases response messaging on that:

* If there is a correlation ID, the broker will set the same ID in a response message.

* If there is no correlation ID, the broker logs a warning and doesn't send a response message. This allows for one-way trade requests as an option, perhaps for manual traders -- but isn't appropriate for your application.

The response from the broker will be of the same XML format as above, except that there will be one additional child element under the <trade> element: a <result> with one of the following values:

FILLED -- trade executed as requested

PARTIALLY_FILLED -- trade executed with some number of shares less than requested -- and you can check the <size> element for the number

REJECTED -- the trade was not executed

Responses may be practically immediate, or may take up to 10 seconds, and actual time will vary, message-by-message, simulating real-world slowdowns.
